<summary>What IDE should I use?</summary>

> An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software suite that consolidates basic tools required to write and test software. Most Front End Devs work with code editors. Some may say code editors are not technically IDE, while most use the terms interchangeably.

An IDE is an essential part of any developers tool kit if you work in front end usually a great code editor is one that features a well-designed, super efficient, and ultra speedy user interface. There are several that do this well, there are also folks who think it's super important but it doesn't really matter. Ultimately it is a tool and none is necessarily better than another or "Best" you just choose the one that will make you a more efficient coder. The one you use is a matter of preference however here is a short list of the most popular.

-   [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
-   [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
-   [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
-   [Atom](https://atom.io/)
-   [Brackets](http://brackets.io/)

Once you've been programming for a bit you realize that the minimum requirements for front end code editors is that they assist you with a few essential functions such as syntax highlighting, suggestions to an extent and indentation, some may also have an integrated terminal, but then if you start trying out a few you start to develop a preference.

Someone may personally use a certain editor when first learning then perhaps switch to another since a professor or a tutorial instructor used it and it was easier to following along with the same editor. Keep in mind also most of these editors will offer the ability to add extensions and these can make programming much easier. If you search the web you will find tons of opinions on the best editors and the most popular extensions. The best part about extensions is that they are usually available to use, no matter the editor you have.

<summary>How do I host a website on GitHub?</summary>

See GitHub's instructions here: https://pages.github.com/

GitHub allows you to host static pages on their infrastucture either as HTML pages or built with the Jekyll static site generator. By default they will use the domain https://[yourname].github.io/, but you can set up a CNAME with your DNS provider to host them at your own domain.
